### **Objective:**

The primary objective of this project is to analyze and extract meaningful insights from customer and credit card data using MySQL. The project aims to:
- Understand customer behavior and preferences.
- Analyze credit card usage, transactions, and financial trends.
- Identify patterns in customer satisfaction, credit limit, income levels, and more.
- Provide actionable insights for business decision-making, such as marketing strategies, risk management, and customer segmentation.



### **Key Features:**

1. **Customer Segmentation & Profiling:**
   - Analyze customer demographics (age, gender, education, income, etc.) to segment the customer base.
   - Identify high-value customers based on credit limit, transaction amounts, and satisfaction scores.

2. **Credit Card Usage Analysis:**
   - Track total transaction volumes and amounts for each customer.
   - Analyze credit utilization ratios and revolving balances.
   - Identify patterns in credit card activation and delinquency.

3. **Financial Metrics and Ranking:**
   - Rank customers based on total transactions, income, credit limit, and customer satisfaction score.
   - Compute averages and percentiles to compare individual customer metrics against overall or segmented groups.

4. **Data Enrichment through Advanced Queries:**
   - Leverage Common Table Expressions (CTEs), window functions, subqueries, and joins to derive complex insights.
   - Use ranking functions to identify top-performing customers in various categories (income, transaction volume, satisfaction).
   - Perform comparisons across demographics, time periods, and other attributes like quarter, state, or card category.

5. **Custom Financial Reporting:**
   - Generate cumulative sums and averages for transaction amounts, revolving balances, and customer acquisition costs.
   - Create financial projections and identify trends in quarterly and annual spending behavior.

6. **Customer Loyalty & Satisfaction Analysis:**

   - Identify customers with higher satisfaction rates and explore factors contributing to loyalty.



### **Technologies Used:**

1. **Database Management:**
   - **MySQL:** Primary relational database management system used to store, query, and analyze customer and credit card data.

2. **Data Analysis Techniques:**
   - **Window Functions**: Used for ranking, cumulative sums, averages, and other advanced calculations.
   - **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Simplify complex queries by organizing intermediate results.
   - **Subqueries and Joins**: Enable comparisons across multiple tables (customer and credit_card) for deeper insights.
   - **Aggregations & Groupings**: Key to summarize data and extract high-level metrics, such as averages, totals, and counts.

3. **SQL Functions:**
   - **Ranking Functions:** `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, `NTILE()`
   - **Aggregation Functions:** `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MAX()`, `MIN()`
   - **Partitioning & Ordering:** To compare customers within specific groups or categories.

### **Explanation**

This project focuses on analyzing customer and credit card data using **MySQL** to derive actionable insights for businesses. By leveraging SQL queries, including **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**, **window functions**, **subqueries**, and **joins**, the project aims to extract meaningful patterns from two primary datasets: customer demographics and credit card usage information.

The analysis covers key areas such as customer segmentation, financial behavior, credit card usage, and satisfaction levels. These insights help in better understanding customer behavior, identifying high-value clients, and recognizing financial trends, ultimately guiding business decisions in marketing, customer engagement, and risk management.

**Key outcomes** include a clearer picture of customer satisfaction, credit utilization, and transaction trends, empowering businesses to optimize resources, target marketing efforts, and make data-driven financial decisions.
